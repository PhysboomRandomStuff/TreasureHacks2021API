An API for TreasureHacks2021

Note: This API is not very secure since we didn't have the time to fully secure everything, so we strongly recommend against storing anything sensitive here

We also understand that you are supposed to hide firebase API service accounts and anything else sensitive through environment variables. This was originally going to be a private
repo that we would delete and turn into a public repo without the sensitive information, but we decided that showing commit history for this hackathon was more important than
not getting hacked. 

Please don't hack us, even though we know you can :)
